2-25-2024,1:15:00 PM,1,Urban company- the worst ever company,"Worst company ever, highly unprofessional technicians. Their only objective is to fleece money out of the customers."
2-14-2024,10:45:00 AM,1,Feeling LOOTED!!!!!,Feeling LOOTED!!!!!....For Chimney Cleaning ...I was charged 600 Rupees ... same simple work could have been done by any house maid by Rs 50-100 tip ?? Guys BEWARE the Kind of work to be done and it Charges......don't get Fooled
02-07-2024,3:12:00 AM,1,Worst service,"Wastage of money and time, there professionals are unskilled unprofessional and no sense of time … i have tried there services 5 6 time in 3 year there services are getting bad and bad…they will never come at time, either they will come 1 hou early or one hour late .. no point of booking an appointment"
01-06-2024,2:12:00 PM,1,Urban company full body massage head to toe,"I recently booked a full-body massage from Urban Company, hoping for a relaxing experience. However, my encounter with Dhanjay Kumar Singh was far from satisfactory. To start, he arrived late at 11:30 AM, which was quite inconvenient. During the massage, the pressure applied was disappointingly weak, hardly providing the relief I had anticipated. It felt more like a gentle touch rather than a massage aimed at relieving tension and stress.

To compound my disappointment, the session ended abruptly after just 90 minutes, well short of the promised duration for a full-body massage. When I voiced my concerns about the lack of pressure, Mr. Singh suggested I should have chosen a ""pain relief"" package, an unprofessional and insensitive response to my valid concerns. My expectation was a rejuvenating experience, but instead, I left feeling unsatisfied and frustrated.

Maintaining the quality and professionalism of services is crucial for Urban Company's reputation, and I urge them to reconsider offering services with Dhanjay Kumar Singh."
12-21-2023,1:52:00 PM,1,Unprofessional behaviour,"Urban company showcases that it’s organised. For everything which they mess up all they have is to say sorry. Instead of solving they ask you to do a few more things .

I booked an appointment for getting chimney repair . 20mins before the scheduled time the technician calls and say I am in the hospital since yesterday. Instead of assigning a new technician they are asking me to reschedule the appointment because customer time is free.

Now I have to cancel it and redo the entire thing.

Then they don’t have a number you have to talk to a chat bot .

Never get their services if you got it then thank god on that day. Else be ready to go round and round . They will give you good stories as they are good at it."
11-27-2023,10:45:00 AM,1,Urban Company Warranty Fraud,"I  booked a cracking sound from TV complaint on urban company on 2nd October 2023. They quoted some 3500/- for repair.

I accepted quote, they took my TV, repaired it and returned on a payment of Rs.3420/-.

But problem recurred in a month or so. Since they had given warranty that they will repair for free if the same problem occurred again in six months, I booked a revisit on 15 Nov again.

They again took my TV, repaired it and returned. But this time, the cracking sound returned within a week with additional problem of screen going blank.

I again tried to book a revisit. They registered but then closed complaint after a few days without any revisit. And they have designed their app in such a manner, that there is no way that I could book a revisit or claim warranty.

To carry out their intentional fraud of not honouring their warranty, they froze their app to a single point where I could not proceed on app without paying a paltry Rs.30/-. It was a small amount, so I paid.

But it was a trap I feel, now they refunded this Rs.30/- immediately to my account and claim that the warranty is settled as they have refunded the Rs.30/- payment.

All options of reopening the job are not functional on the app now.

I’m thinking of lodging a case in consumer court now for this blatant fraud. If any learned lawyer can take this case to conclusion, he may DM me here in comments.

I have taken necessary screen shots just in case Urban Company decides to block my account after this complaint."
11-24-2023,2:06:00 PM,1,Installation of M1 water purifier,"Recently I purchased a Native M1 water purifier from Amazon. A technician of Urban Company came to my place for installation two days later. After visiting my place he immediately commented that the space in the kitchen is not suitable for installation. When I asked him why, he said that the space for installation will be too high or too low. He insisted to return the machine and purchase water purifier of some other company. I reported the issue to the company.

Seven days later another technician was sent to my place again. He also refused to install it giving same reason first. I requested him to install it in the kitchen at slightly raised height and I said that collection of water from that level will not be a big problem. He then said that the concealed water pipeline and electrical line may get damaged and many other silly excuses. I then suggested him to install it in the balcony wher both electrical and water connections are available. He again refused to install it and also continuously insisted me to return the machine and purchase water purifier of other company. He also left my place without even unboxing the package.

Highly disappointed with the attitude of technicians for refusing to install it without showing acceptable reasons.

I had a feeling of some foul play behind it; these technicians might work for other companies.

Urban Company should be cautious about these kind of technicians who are damaging the reputation of the company."
11-17-2023,,1,Worst service,"WORST - I have purchased M2 Water Purifier. To install the Machine no proper technician available. Simply attended as an officer of customer and said that It can be installed and the Machine is not suitable to install. He wants to install on open space and near by sink or Morie so that in case of machine leaks it will go to sink. He is not able answer why the leakage will get. Finally, we collect back the machine and refund will be initiated. WORST. i READ THE LEAKAGE ISSUE OF MACHINE ON THE ASSURENCE OF SALES PEOPLE PURCHASED."
11-16-2023,12:15:00 PM,1,Pathetic company,"I booked for a mens haircut for my father. I immediately received a booking confirmation for 11am. However, I did not receive any intimation from them till 11:40am. After I called on the number, the assigned person had the audacity to say I was sleeping so I will come at 12:30pm.

At 12noon I got a message from Urban Company saying your appointment has been cancelled and that they have rescheduled it for 2pm. This was assuming your customers are waiting for your fraud and pathetic response. I have no option but to cancel their service and henceforth will never assign Urban Company for anything."
11-16-2023,10:33:00 AM,2,Unprofessional ``professionals'',"We needed a 3BHK flat cleaned urgently before a deadline for a new tenant to move in. We booked UC for the job. On the appointed

day, the professional cleaner showed up and told us incorrectly that this was `not 3BHK' and refused to do the job unless we cancelled the booking, as an incorrect booking, paying a cancellation fee. We were also to pay him directly(not the Urban Company) `under the table' for doing the job. We complained to Urban Company, who

understood the situation and refunded our cancellation fee. The cleaning `professional' called us and abused us over the phone for informing UC. We went through a lot of stress as a result. We feel UC should not be hiring such people. Luckily we found a professional

alternative in Clean Fanatics, who came and did the job perfectly."
11-15-2023,8:15:00 PM,1,Chimney cleaning very un professional,"The chimney started dripping oil in 10 days, when called support they say I should have reported this within 72 hours

I paid Rs. 700/ - for this ."
11-15-2023,11:35:00 AM,1,Always cancelling the booking on the spot,"The worst company, they keep cancelling the bookings on the time of cleaner need to arrive, or they reschedule fir another day with out informing the customer. You find out just when you text them to check why the professional is late.

For Urban company this is normal. No compensation, no apology. They are so unprofessional on scheduling."
11-11-2023,4:56:00 PM,1,HARASSMENT,UC professionals have HARASSED me on diwali. Upon escalation I received zero support. Extremely horrible experience be safe beware they harass customers and dont take ownership of their behaviour
11-08-2023,7:55:00 PM,1,Disaaointment home ckeaning service and moonligjti,"Booked home cleaning service for my 1 bhk flat for 8;00 am. Cleaning team of 2 people show- up at 8.30 am with no intimation of being late. As per the pricess manager enters OTP the moment the work begins, no show from manager. Only 2 team members show up, 2nd one is called, up by the team leader at 9.30 am and he is away from the job site for 1.5 hours. Only 1 member does the cleaning. 2 members (includes team leader) show up at 11:00 am. Seems 2 of them were finishing floor cleaning and vacuuming for another customer. At 1 pm team of 3 wind up work, with window glass of my toilet broken and half finished work, Shabby work delivery. Extremely dissatisfied with thei services during Diwali. Urban company I have lost trust in your brand and your work ethics. Stop moonlighting if you can't handle high customer demand during festive time."
11-03-2023,5:34:00 PM,1,My painting work experience with UC,"Recently I got my house painting done by Urban Company. Their advertisements are misleading -'ek bhi galti ho toh pura painting free'. They are very costly and the service quality is very very poor. They said there is 1 yr warranty. I called the person who did the painting work for me to rectify the work done by him. He stopped answering my calls. Then I made a complaint to UC, but no action taken so far. Think twice before you engage UC for any work. They are not professionals"
11-03-2023,3:53:00 PM,1,Urban company M1 ro order not delivered no refund,My name Aditya Mishra. I ordered urban company M1 ro 21 oct. It's not delivered after 10 days & status is showing sheeping
11-02-2023,5:02:00 PM,1,Cleaning services by Urban,Very unprofessional behaviour by the company employees.Not trust worthy and they are cheating the customers.They are blocking the slots in online and on calling to their Customer care no they said slots are not available but I am calling back with another number and I will book the slots for you.They are calling with their personal numbers and saying sir though slots are not available but I will give you slot for that you have to pay the extra charges as premium services and they are asking money for 6400 instead of 3400 for the same job which shows on their app.Totally wasting time and money .They are only for making money.Though company may not be saying to do so but they must check on their employees. They have wasted my time. Though this was my first time trying to book but first impression goes worst.
10-29-2023,5:30:00 PM,1,"Worst service, hidden charges and unreliable","My TV repair done through urban company didn't even last for a month. Also at the time of repair initially the repairmen didn't convey that it would cost us 5k Rs. and later I was compelled to pay the amount. I would have instead repaired my TV locally, atleast it would have been durable."
10-24-2023,4:36:00 PM,1,Tricking customers,"I used UC to evaluate for a painting service. They came home with an instrument to measure the room size. I can say that they are fooling the customer by doing misinterpretation of measurement by using this instrument which is not correctly showing the value. I have observed that this instrument is not calibrated , hence the value it shows cannot be trusted."
10-20-2023,10:24:00 PM,5,Service based,"I am so glad to review this urban company. I used many services like water purifier , a/c general service, fridge repair and washing machine repair , plumbing , electrical services"
10-17-2023,12:18:00 PM,1,Worst company ever,"Five months ago, I called Urban Company to repair an AC. The technician first said the gas must have run out -- I had got it filled just a month earlier from them so it was supposedly under warranty. When I told him that, he said the warranty for places near water bodies was 15 days! (My flat is not that close to any water body -- by this logic, every place is Bombay is.)Anyway, he checked the AC and said the gas was ok. After two days of trying to figure out what was wrong, he said two parts needed to be replaced. He quoted an exorbitant amount for second-hand components which, the AC company told me was more than what new parts cost. Anyway, since I had to get it done, I paid up. Today, five months later, the AC is not working again.

This company has incompentent technicians, overcharges and does not give warranties. The worst part is that it does not have a dedicated number, and there is no way to complain directly. If you look at the Urban Company reviews anywhere, there are hundreds of complaints against it but it remains untouched. If we had anything like a class action lawsuit in India (where many people get together and file a case), this company would be taken to the cleaners. It deserves to be shut down."
10-17-2023,9:13:00 AM,1,Company is unprofessional.,"I booked for electrician on 21.09.2023, the company failed to assign tech for the job in allotted time slot and I cancelled the service, I have not received refund till date, it's customer care number is not available to lodge complaint and on my mobile the reply says no refund will be issued, that is surprising, I think the company is not trustworthy and is not proffessinoal.

The behaviour of company is cheating customer"
10-14-2023,,1,"
1.0 out of 5 stars Expensive service poor customer care","Very expensive service, electrician worked for one hr and charges were INR 800. Very poor customer service, no phone number for customer care. Very poor response from customer care, almost impossible to get through."
10-11-2023,5:18:00 PM,1,Scary cleaners threatened my elderly parents,"I have been using UC for years now for home cleaning, haircuts, painting, carpentry, etc. Two days ago Masud (cleaner) was assigned to clean my home on a Classic package. He waited for my brother to leave for work and then started pestering my 70+ year old dad for more money and to upgrade the package to premium. My dad doesn't know about the packages since I book everything for them on the app. My dad agreed to pay 4k more than what I booked. He then started threatening my parents that he wanted the money before the job is done. He went into my mother's bedroom and started shouting. I called the UC trust center as soon as my mom called me in panic (I don't live in the same state as my parents). I told Masud to leave my house at once or I'd call the police. He kept threatening then after UC also told him, he finally left. He made my parent's home so dirty and threw water everywhere. My parents were so scared. UC kept asking for time since I wanted to file a FIR. Two days later they are calling to close the ticket and gave RS150 coupons. Such unprofessional idiots. Please be careful with elderly and safety of your lived ones. I don't think they are vetting their staff properly. Very horrible and scary experience."

9-26-2023,11:36:00 AM,1,"Poor, unprofessional, horrible, shameless service","I wanted to get my washing machine repaired as it was tripping continuously. The technician came and gave me an estimate of 6500rs. I denied the extra that they were charging to change the motor. So I requested a call from UC to understand. The technician agent Ritwik initially said that the motor can be changed later and the seal bearing can be changed for now. However, I will not get an guarantee for the entire machine. I agreed to that. The technician started working, he opened the machine and was checking. Suddenly he received a call to stop the work and leave my place. I never received any call from UC regarding stopping of work. I called UC and they said they will not do the work if I don't change the motor. This clearly shows that UC didn't do my work since I was not ready to pay for the motor which was actually not needed to be changed but was added to squeeze extra money. The technician over the phone was rude and behaved unprofessionally.

The technician stopped the work without even informing me."
9-24-2023,4:09:00 PM,1,Not Satisfied With Their Cleaning Service,"I booked their services to have my bathroom thoroughly cleaned, but the results were nothing short of abysmal. It's astonishing how a company that claims to provide professional cleaning services could fall so short of expectations.

Firstly, the cleaner arrived late, which was an inconvenience from the start. When they finally got to work, it became apparent that they had no idea what a ""thorough"" cleaning meant. The bathroom was left in a worse state than it was before their arrival. There were still visible stains on the tiles, soap scum on the shower glass, and grime in the corners that had been entirely neglected.

To make matters worse, they used harsh chemicals that left an overpowering, unpleasant odor that lingered for hours. I expected a fresh, clean scent, but instead, my bathroom smelled like a chemical factory.

Customer service was equally disappointing. When I contacted UrbanCompany.com to express my dissatisfaction, they were unresponsive and unapologetic. It's clear they prioritize profit over customer satisfaction.

I wouldn't recommend UrbanCompany.com to anyone seeking quality cleaning services. Their incompetence, poor customer service, and lack of professionalism are truly frustrating and make it a waste of time and money. Avoid at all costs."
9-20-2023,3:40:00 PM,1,Urban company non professional services,"In last 2 years I booked 3 to 4 services from urban company. In all the cases, their non professionals have rescheduled my booking slot by themselves without my permission. In my last booking for kitchen cleaning, their non professional spoke to me and I insisted not to reschedule at all. He said ok, disconnected the call and rescheduled. In one other case, that time I was a member and they rescheduled it after 2 days. Their non professional came, did the service and within 10 days the problem appeared. One other surprising thing is their non professionals carry central government’s skill development certificate which is to cheat people. Finally I cancelled my service and booked it thru nobroker. Nobroker’s professionals came on time in fact 3mins before scheduled time. So I decided not to use urban company app anymore and simply use nobroker as alternative."
9-17-2023,12:44:00 PM,1,Poor service by Urban Company,I booked a professional from urban company for ac repair and they have made the condition worst than before. All lies and no truth about it. I have ask3d for compenstation of the product damaged by their professional.
9-16-2023,10:39:00 PM,1,Frauds,Booked Premium deep cleaning service for my house. cleaners came. turned the house Topsy turvy. I asked them to clean a corner. cleaner got angry and aggressive saying I was interfering. he pulled his appliance plug out and left leaving the house in bigger mess. I requested him to finish the workor at least fix back the house. he said I should deal with urban company. I tried to complain to Urban company. they did nothing to amend the situation.
9-16-2023,10:41:00 AM,1,Commitment Issue,We booked slot seven days before and we are planning accordingly but few hours before they cancelled. It's very unfortunate. This is clearly commitment issue.
09-10-2023,9:47:00 PM,1,Service Not Satisfactory,"I recently booked a pedicure service with Urban Company, and unfortunately, I must say that I was quite disappointed with the experience. The service was far from satisfactory, and here's why:

Rushed and Inattentive: The professional who arrived at my place seemed disinterested from the beginning. It felt like he was just going through the motions to complete the service as quickly as possible. There was a clear lack of attention to detail.

Faulty Equipment: To add to my disappointment, the equipment he brought along appeared to be faulty. The foot spa wasn't working correctly, and it took several attempts to get it started. This wasted valuable time and left me feeling frustrated.

Incomplete Work: One of the most essential aspects of a pedicure is the removal of dead skin and calluses. Unfortunately, this crucial step was overlooked. I could still feel rough patches on my feet, which was disappointing.

Minimal Massage: The brief foot massage I received was for a mere minute, if not less. A good pedicure should include a relaxing and rejuvenating massage, which was notably absent in this case.

Overall, my experience with Urban Company's pedicure service was subpar, and I did not receive the quality of service I expected. I hope this feedback helps them improve their services and ensure that customers receive the excellent and relaxing experience they deserve."
09-09-2023,10:12:00 PM,1,My worst experience towards this company,"This is the worst company I have ever visited to. I don't like the overall company worst experience.
"
09-09-2023,10:03:00 PM,1,Fraud organisation on the name of providing servic,"Worst experience with the unprofessional service partners and customer support when approached. They doesn't know how to communicate with a loyal customer and resolve an issue with some dignity. Simply copy and paste apology message and 50rs Urban Credit as if we are begging them. Most of the service partners visit home, ask us to cancel the booking, then do the service and charge us personally that too with a scan code, since we can raise a complaint when amount is paid to their contact number. Be aware of these fraud service partners"
09-01-2023,7:50:00 PM,1,Worst quality painting service,"Worst customer service and worst painting quality issues. Customer care executive give flase promises and say aorry we can't do anything right now. I love to support you air but we are helpless.

Sajid is executive done the painting service - he is not having any experience and absconding after stated raising painting quality issues. Never respond to customer complaints. Never book any service from urban company."
8-31-2023,12:11:00 PM,1,Classic full House cleaning,"I hope u ready my review before u ask urban company to come and clean ur house. Urban company services are a ripoff. No value for money. We asked for a full home cleaning. The job was average for the price charged to just do a dusting job that to with only a dry cloth for 3000/- and they tell u that what u ordered for u want us to use a wet cloth pay nother 1000. And u need to be vigilant on the cleaning as they will do a superficial job. We had to point out that u have missed some spot here or there, in-fact after the clean I felt my house was more dusty than before. The company should we sued for fake advertising they don’t have any tech for deep cleaning etc. though I dint give a bad rating for the guys on the app. As I just wanted to get done with them. But I will never call urban company again for any services and have deleted the app as well."
8-18-2023,7:32:00 PM,1,Very bad service,Dont go for this company anymore waste of money people dint worked proper for premium plan and asking for extra money before starting work itself
8-18-2023,4:36:00 PM,1,Plumbing / Plumber services with Urban company Ban,"Booked for 2 services with UC, Bangalore(1) Health facet pipe leaking(2) PVC flush tank leaking and paid Rs. 346 as per tariff card on 15.08.2023. Partner came on 16.08.2023 and rectified(1) health facet pipe leaking work. However he could not attend / complete / do the work of(2) Flush tank leak and suggest for replacement of the tank. He volunteered to buy a tank and fix it at a slightly enhanced cost as per tariff card. I agreed to pay the difference. I told him that I buy the new flush tank and asked him to come and fix. He was supposed to come on 17th. When I called him on 17th evening, he said on 18th pucca. But did not turn up. The company app is also useless under such circumstance. Since the partner did not do the job for one work they should return the amount after deducting visitation fee or complete the job as per the tariff applicable for that work. The company is unresponsive. At times consumers cannot exactly identify the problem areas and chose the work specified in the app only. There is no facility for discussion in their app. Nor the officials / help desk come on line to find out. Hence it is not advisable to approach them unless the problem areas are fully identified and that matches the work attended by the partner later on."
8-17-2023,7:03:00 PM,1,Shockingly bad,"Consistently shady services. Jobs incomplete or need revisiting and when a revisit is booked it gets cancelled as miraculously someone has flu. When questioned the flu excuse disappears and now all of a sudden my ac unit model has only meant to chill to 24 degrees. No thorough checks of the problem were conducted and still no resolution. Company guarantees of revisits are not honoured. Cleaning services are in consistent and the professional regularly changed without prior notice being given. Horrendous customer service, zero value for money, completely unprofessional. Avoid at all costs."
8-15-2023,12:10:00 PM,1,Worst app,Worst app and there us no proper support graphics and no faq section and also it is not working properly
08-09-2023,1:47:00 PM,3,UC Associates/Partners duping the company,"Many times I book the service and as per schedule the UC Associate/Partner attends to my booking. However while rendering the repair with spare and accessories they charge us privately and the booking is closed with mere attendance. UC loses its due share in the process. The Associate/Partner states that they use the platform for accessing the booking. However since the payment by UC is not decent or reasonable, they resort to this practice.Gullible customers forget one thing that they lose warranty in the process.

Many a time the scope of repair is not adequate. For instance the spares of Sony TV would not be available with them and they ask the customer to approach a technician known to them, say an authorised service agent of Sony. We end up in losing the visit charges. UC has left several loose ends in their service and repair category. We call a plumber for resolving a drainage issue, but he will refuse the work as out of scope and eventually we loose the visit charges."
08-05-2023,11:05:00 PM,1,WORSE EXPERIENCE!,NEVER BOOK THEIR SERVICES AND WASTE TIME! THERE IS ALWAYS SOME GLITCH ON THEIR APP AND THE CANCELING BOOKINGS LAST MINUTE FROM THEIR SIDE. IT'S JUST CRAP CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE!
08-02-2023,1:30:00 PM,1,Worst service at Urban company!They burned my hair,"Guys never trust the stylists from Urban Company for hair colour or pre lightening as you’ll end up crying and screwing your hair , time and money . As he came separately for the service telling me that he’ll very professional and have whole knowledge about the hair and the products he’s using but I had a nightmare of my life even after paying 7K even the colour was mine but my hair looked like dry and broken . Don’t believe in their overconfidence and go to a good salon who are specialists in Colors and pre lightening . I wish I could upload the picture of my hair with this review but I have posted in urban company photo and image gallery ."
7-31-2023,10:55:00 PM,1,Poor Service Quality by UC,Very high quality Marble (floor )of wash room of newly built house got damaged by the poor quality products used by the company employees for cleaning . No one from the company called even after the feedback provided. Will definitely take legal course.
7-28-2023,8:04:00 PM,1,"Thief, Muggers, tried to do a robbery","Urban Company : Thief, muggers, higly unprofessional. WORST

I booked a professional (with 4.95 rating)and she was caught red handed with a diamond ring she stole from my dressing worth Rs. 2 lakhs. And where did i find it: in the hot wax container. She acted so smart with me and stripped naked and asked me to check her completely. I found the ring in the most unusal place which was inside the wax. This is such a pathetic experience and Urban Company is not ready to do anything about it. I have uninstalled this app and i never want to experience the same.

Professional details are in the screenshot and trust me Urban Company are muggers."
7-28-2023,11:28:00 AM,2,Customer satisfaction is not the top priority,"Urban Company is a hit or a miss. The application is designed well, and the idea of training the uneducated youth is laudable, but the execution is pathetic. There is no apt support in the case of damage to the property. I don't think it is a concern for the upper management.

Ideally, the company should train the poor gig workers and maintain the service standards somehow. The only cleaning items workers should use are company-provided items. In case of damage, it should be the company's responsibility/CEO's responsibility to ensure the damage is fixed. Unfortunately, that does not happen in India, as there are no strict laws to protect consumers.

In India, I had two incidents, one where the cleaner broke the sink and a second where he poured acid on toilet sink handles, removing the polish. The support was a sorry statement with a starting offer of 250 Rs, which went to the 2000 Rs offer.

The company takes a good cut from the poor gig worker and takes money from customers for a service, but there is no guarantee for the quality of the service. It's a Profit machine great for investors. This is a dream business!

The company will be sued in the US if they don't replace the broken item and improve services.

I hope the CEO Abhiraj Singh Bhal and the team improve the existing system."

7-25-2023,10:54:00 AM,1,Worst and expensive UC - AC Service,"UC assigned some local vendor from Noida and one senior service engineer visited our house for Split AC repair. We paid almost INR 5600.00(UC booking, AC service, gas and some valve part change. Though he didn't show me or handed faulty part. AC worked and started cooling but within week again stopped cooling.

Called him again, he confirmed Capacitor needs replacement as part is old(our AC is 6 yrs old and hardly used) he brought R290 gas from market and start refilling. I asked him show capacitor he said NO I said capacity and R290 is capacity need replacement(he charged me additionally INR 1600.00).

AC again stop cooling within 2-3 hours, calling him again but no response. PLEASE STOP this dirty business UC, you have no quality check on service providers.

Another Window AC service - They didnt remove from window simply sprayed from outside. next day AC air was smelling bad of dirty stored water inside. Same complained him, but no response."

7-22-2023,11:40:00 AM,4,AC Gas leak repair problem,"Had got my o general split ac gas refilled. Engineer found gas leak at one point and repaired it using handheld welding can and gun. Within a week gas again leaked, engineer came and said gas leaking three points, while repairing said gas started leaking from five new points. He said the internal unit could not be repaired and will have to be changed. Took help from customer care who were really helpful. The problem I pointed out to them was that the gas was leaking because of excess heat caused by wrong welding. After much talk with the customer care the engineer welded the gas leak at low flame using gas cylinder. The ac is working fine now."

To UC's credit, they did arrange for the ""professionals"" to return to complete the job and gave a partial refund. 2 days later, I booked handyman services. Less than 5 minutes before the ""professionals"" were due, they informed me they would be ""slightly late"" - then they told me they would be 2 hours late, arriving after 6pm when my kids would be in bed. There was then no time to try and arrange another person to complete the job. Customer service could not do anything apart from initiate a refund. Now I have to wait 7-10 days to get my money back and the job is still not complete."

The product detail says that potli will have herbs and will be dipped in oil. Instead of herbs potli has only salt. It is not dipped in oil but just touched with oil. The oil used does not smell like the ayurvedic oil. It seems your are fooling people by charging so heavily and not providing the correct product."
07-09-2023,6:34:00 AM,1,Fraud company fake comittment,"Its a big fraud company. I booked a home laptop repair service on 8th july 2023, as per advertisement it was told its free service with no visit charge and laptop will be repaired at the doorstep infront of me as per problem it was told rs 450 shall be charged . I agreed to pay

. A person came to me have no id of urban company, said tne company hires local venders

Was having no knowledge of fault

And asked me to take away my laptop for two days as he has no equipment to repair it at home. and told me charges will be rs 1000/-or higher . I denied because he had no id of urban company and charges was more than double than told earlier.

He asked me to pay Rs. 150 as visit charge. I asked him that on sline booking was showed free visit. He told website is not updated since long .hence you pay rs 150. Any how I paid rs. 150 without any service. Thd Urban company is cheating people like this . dont take any service from urban company they are fraud and looting peoples with their fake advertising."
07-07-2023,1:40:00 PM,1,Urban Company Fees and Pricing,"Their pricing is designed to force you to add services before you are allowed to checkout. They also make it difficult to reach out to their customer service team. Their pricing after the work is opaque - neither their partners nor UC clearly explain what you are paying for when material is purchased. UC has made it a habit to add fees even for customers who sign up for annual membership. I feel that UC is laser focused on upselling services that are more than average in price and adding innovative fees on top of annual subscription fees. Since they are a monopoly, I often have to use them. But I have certainly cut down on the number of times I have used their services."
07-04-2023,5:47:00 PM,1,URBAN COMPANY IS CHEATED,"Whole booked they charged by showing solution of Low cooling but when they visited they given the different bill and said it was our visiting charges for inspections?

I called the customer care to send someone to fix it. After that, everyday 5 different 'experts' came, all claiming it was not their department. I got frustrated as i would have different people in my house everyday plus my AC was not working in peak summers. So i called the company service centre. They diagnosed the issue in 5 mins and replace d the PCB in a day. However, i had to pay 8, 5 k from my pocket"
06-12-2023,7:32:00 PM,1,"Ac repair, a fraud","I got my 1 ton ac repaired and I was told to raise complain if not satisfied with 1 month warranty.

But after 38 days ac cooling stopped, I checked urban company but you can never contact customer care, and since warrant expire within month, the need one more payment for same problem after 38 days.

I tried to understand the problem, some liquid can block leakage for some days or leakage was that minimal it takes a month to leak.

Either it was not repaired properly or some liquid which sustain for a period they knows well.

Try to get local repair person, at least they can be reached."
06-07-2023,11:16:00 PM,1,How Urban Company is fooling customers ,"Recently Urban Company found a new way to con customers, by offering laptop repair services by Thugs appointed by them as partners.

Considering we were a happy customer using non-technical services, we tried our luck in getting our laptop repaired by their partner named Radha Krishan Rakhija, who very casually opened our HP Pavilion 360 Laptop without scanning the machine as he was attending multiple phone calls which damaged the touch screen, USB port & fan. The ONLY issue was with the speed of the laptop for which he suggested to remove the HDD and replace it with SDD for which the quote was approx. 3k. He got this job by promising that he can fix this in 15-20 mins as that was a mere replacement of HDD with SDD, but instead of replacing the SDD properly, he damaged the touch screen, USB port & fan.

Since he couldn’t fix the laptop on 26th May and we insisted to keep the job pending as the asset was damaged, he came to collect the laptop on 28th May by promising to hand it over on 29th / 30th May at max but he went silent for 4 days and when we reached out to him if touch screen and fan is repaired, he confirmed that both were working fine(screenshot of chat attached). On 1st June, he sent a quote of Rs 5654/-(screenshot of chat attached) in which he mentioned spare parts replacement as SSD+ RAM+ USB Port and when we pushed back on RAM(as he initially suggested to not add RAM as SSD would be sufficient), he very conveniently suggested to leave it. In the evening he visited our place and narrated a new story that now the motherboard is damaged and total spend will be Rs 15k, which made me 100% sure that we are being conned by him. When I mentioned that all his conversations are recorded through CCTV camera and none of it matches with the fresh diagnosis which he produces every single time, he got scared and offered to replace the motherboard at his own expense. For almost 1 hr, he was pleading to take our laptop once again to his shop to repair it but since he was not willing to add the motherboard expense to the quote, we escalated this matter to Urban Company. While Urban Company was investigating the matter, the technician closed the job and now Urban Company has removed the chat from their system to safeguard his partner.

Very smartly, they assigned 1 more technician(Sudhanshu Mohan Dixit) who came to our place on 3rd June and obviously played smartly by demeaning the earlier technician and promising to repair all the faults and accepted on camera that motherboard is working fine. He also showed us multiple connectors broken(1 pic attached) which may have damaged touchscreen connection. The 2nd technician promised to return the laptop by 4th Jun and now when we are checking with him, he is not responding at all.

Urban Company not just have army of con-mans as their partners but the contact centre executives are equally trained to fool their customers. The CC executive started batting from their partners end and called us today stating the motherboard was damaged and it was confirmed by both the technicians and we have to bear the cost of it until the time it is replaced, touchscreen as well as the USB port will not function.

Every single day, they buy time for 1 more day assuring that the matter will be resolved to our satisfaction whereas they have a complete nexus of trained professionals at all levels to fool customers.

My today’s submission to the call from the smart call centre executive for our escalation is to throw the laptop in dustbin as now I am going to share daily, video clips of their partners who came to my place and have been continuously trying to fool us."
06-05-2023,10:19:00 PM,1,Air condition service,"Very very worst service by UC, i called them for repairing my AC , they charged 7800, replaced part n filled gas, but with in 2 days same in bad condition, i called them multiple time to convey that service has not done properly but no proper response..

06-05-2023,9:17:00 PM,1,Pathetic ac servicing,"I placed order for 3 air conditioner servicing with urban company.

First ac plastic part broken by the technician. Beep noise stopped while changing temperature/on off/mode change. Samsung ac.

Second ac newest one -motherboard destroyed. Took it for repair and returned it after 3 days. Motherboard repair costs 4000 paid by urban company. Hisense ac.

Third ac - Digital display one digit stopped growing. Left it like that. No repairing done. LG ac

I am repenting now why l did not called the company technicians for servicing who has better knowledge of their product.

Urban company technicians don't know anything about ac servicing and just work like car wash personnel.

They were doing video call with urban company call center to open the motherboard.

Never do servicing with urban company if you want to keep your expensive ac safe."
06-01-2023,5:57:00 PM,1,Customer,"The company is a cheat and will only do what they think is clean, generally the company policy is very bad and their standards are below basic standards . Better using local people, their system of timing is all over the place, the time slots do not mean anything ! Substandard service, they are just interested in money and not service !"
5-28-2023,,1,Gas leakage caused and condenser damaged,"I had breakfast booked for my four AC servicing at 1950 which were running fine. They caused gas leakage in one AC and caused condenser damage in another AC. They are not equipped to even open and check the AC rightly. After making servicing payment, we are made to pay 3500 for gas filling in one AC and 10000 for condenser repair and gas filling in another AC. So total loss of 15450. So boycott urban company."
5-25-2023,6:04:00 PM,3,UrbanCompany Technicians are fraud. BAN THE COMPA,"I called for AC service. Technician came did service and said AC is not cooling may be gas not there. I told him its a 2 years old AC it shouldn't have problem. He checked and said gas is empty need to fill orelse compressor will have problem. I told him check for leakage and fill the gas, he did checking of leakage and filled the gas and charged 2500/-. Now we got to know that again gas is empty and there is a leakage. I could not call the Urban Company because there is no customer care number and chat is not helpful in the APP.I calledtechnician and he is tellingwarrenty is over, its only for 3 months i cannot help you. Already your company have very bad reviews on servicing. Whoever opt for any appliance later they face something than the other repairs on that. I mailed the issue to Urban Company but reply came resolve your issue in APP. HOW GOVERMENT IS ALLOWINH THIS COMPANY WITHOUT CUSTOMER CARE NUMBER IN APP ????If there is no Customer Care number how can we give feedback and resove our problem after service. URBAN COMPANY IS FRAUD AND CHEATING CUSTOMERS."
5-22-2023,4:50:00 PM,1,Urban Company is making fool to the Customers.,"I have booked a Inverter servicing from Urban Company. For that they have charged Rs249 + tax. The package includes Distilled water top up and cleaning services.

Now when the professional came he was asking money to buy distilled water, transportation cost to bring the distilled water.

Now this ?249+tax is for only to see the face of the professional, you like the face or not that's upto your choice.

Now if you agree for the extra money for distilled water, he will ask for the transportation cost for bringing the distilled water.

If you call any professional for distilled water top up from a local inverter dealer they will charge you Rs 60 without cleaning or servicing.

Never ever go for any Inverter Service from Urban Company."
5-22-2023,7:52:00 AM,1,Unprofessional service provider,"Urban Clay's setvice providers are unreliable. After fixing a time slot they kept changing the time slot and didn't respond to my calls. The urban clap site ask to use my registrade phone number, but calling from the number doesn't get response.

5-18-2023,9:10:00 AM,1,Urban Clap should shut the company.,"I am an interior designer. I schedule a slot of morning 8 am for my client house after I completed my interior, total 4/5 people came from urban clap. I booked a 2Bhk premium cleaning + glue, paint stain removing extra. The cleaners didn't know how to remove stains, they told me you just wasted your money by booking 600 Rs extra for that work as we don't even know how to remove those. Later one of the guy started using a sharp tool on the door panelling of the bedroom, it had corian on it. There are scratches on an expensive material now. I called UC customer care to alot me someone professional, they told me that I should not worry as he will arrange me someone better, felt relief after hearing this, they scheduled me 2:30 or 3 arounda new team and I asked the old team to leave but in anger 3 cleaners went inside the washroom and started spitting and making the washroom dirty. My copartner asked them to leave in anger. From that time till now I was calling and chatting with UC constantly for the action on the scratch and the exact timing of new teamto make sure the work gets completed on time as my clients were going to move in. It's 4:30 now, the senior confirmed, no one will be able to come till Wednesday and today is Monday. In all the calls from 12:30 to 4:30, no one had guts to speak the truth that they can't alot me any professional. My waste of time, lost of my energy and my client disappointed is all I got.

Bhavya anand, Saurav Kumar and one their senior assisted me with nothing but a failure of Urban clap.

I have been fined 50000 by my client now, as his house warming party was spoiled, I think Urban clap should bare this fine + bare the repairs which we will have to do because of those scratches which were made purposely."

WHEN I REGISTER COMPLAINT FOR THE DAMAGES RS. 10000.00, THEY REFUSED IT TO HONOUR, NEITHER THEY ARE INTERESTED TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM CUSTOMER NOR THEY TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY OF THEIR TECHNICIAN.

Moral of the story is- Our fridge is now nothing but a toy, all thanks to their'trained' service provider. The LG representatives denied to even touch the fridge as the tamper was beyond repair.

Now after repeated complaints over the last 2 3 days, they are taking no responsibility other than refunding the service amount. Their customer service is even pathetic. Nobody bothers to take any complain, forget being responsible for their services.

They will not escalate such a major issue and will continue sending random untrained people to your home.

I reported that issue and UC told me to they will send an expert to repair

So far so good

Yesterday at 12:00 was the fix time for it

At 15:40 I got the call from UC: Sir, the expert is at your building”

But I was not because I need to work in order to pay as well the services I book through their APP.

So first appointment failed

I got a call with apologies- and a new appointment was fixed. I was assured today at 10:30 will be the time he will come

Instead of the expert I got a phone call telling me “ the expert will come at 15:30”

What is that?

I changed my day routine a second time due to the confirmation of this company?!?!

I insisted someone will come because I can not stop working a third day this week….

So I got confirmation after 15 minutes"" the expert will come 10:30""

Now it is 12:50 and still no one showed up.

This is rediculous and I am thinking to report this matter to consumer protection as I feel not treated as I should be.

This is the worst experience I have had with a company in Dubai."
01-04-2023,9:20:00 PM,1,Fraudulent Service given by Untrained Servicemen,"We have used Urban Company a couple of times at my office for services like bathroom cleaning and plumbing during the pandemic in the year 2020. And twice I myself used their service at my residence once for PC repair and another time for water purifier service.

For the PC Repair, they have sent a third-party employee who came and replaced the HDD and SMPS. For the same, he charged us Rs. 7249/-. Plus visiting charges of Rs. 299/- that I paid earlier while booking the service. He replaced the HDD with a new 1 TB HDD. No cash memo or warranty card for the HDD was given.

Each time the service of Urban Company didn't meet my expectations. But during the pandemic at the office, we were left out of options as the housekeeping staff was not available. And our regular plumber was not responding to calls. The servicemen are not properly trained. Each time the work was disatifactory.

What I understood is that Urban Company lacks in giving the required training to the individual before starting to send them for work.

I personally won't recommend taking service from Urban Company(UC)."

I had booked Urban Company to solve the fan not working issue of my Island chimney, they came and told that it is a motor issue and they need to rebind the armature and change the bush, capacitor and charged around 3, 000/- and the fraudulent mechanic said he will give the capacitor in 400/- for which the company will charge 800/-, and I agreed. After 2 weeks they came back and reinstalled the chimney and I caught them red-handed that capacitor was not changed but billed, then with initial denial, when I showed them the picture of the capacitor that I have already taken earlier and the serial number matched, then they gave a new capacitor with some lame excuses. Now just after 4 months the chimney is again not rotating and their mechanic came(Name is Sushil Kumar Das, the cheater) and said its a motor problem and blamed the earlier mechanic and said nothing was changed. Then I called the previous mechanic, after one and a half week of excuses he finally didn't came and misbehaved over phone. Then I made a booking and he got allocated, which he cancelled from his end and thus got assigned to some other mechanic, to avoid me.Now I am with a non-working chimney and a loss of money."

Never showed up and wasted two full days by stalling the service Please spare yourselves and don't book this service ever. Extremely unprofessional and completely unreliable."
11-15-2022,8:11:00 PM,1,Unethical AND unresponsive,"This review is not about a specific service but about my interaction with the company staff. On one of my cleaning jobs, the person assigned damaged a few mirrors and glasses in my apartment. While UC has a policy to reimburse customers for such damage, it has been an absolute nightmare to get their escalation team to respond and move forward. We have had multiple calls(5+ by my count) and yet I have no idea how I am supposed to get my refund. They don't stick to their deadlines and they don't have a number to call so you are left in the hands of their very poor customer servive. I have about INR 30K+ of damages but due to ""company policy"" they are only going to reimburse me for INR 10K. All my conversations have shown that this company has been extremely unethical and immensely stingy to the point I believe they may have violated consumer protection laws(I am looking into it).

Do you know the worst part? They make the struggling people who do the job pay 50% of all damages EVEN THOUGH they have insurance! These are low-income struggling hardworkers who make mistakes and yet have to give money out of their pocket to a company swimming in crores. I find it absolutely horrfying for a company to stoop so low. I look forward to the the day the headlines talk about their bankruptcy - no company this unethical can or will survive."
11-13-2022,10:37:00 AM,1,Eye lash extention,I had the worst experience with UC. They confirme my booking on 12Nov Saturday and I got a call few hours that no one is available to do The Eye lash service and they had to resched the following day 13th Nov. I had to cancel my previously booked appointment for this eye lash booking. And to its massively dissapointing that no one turned up to do the service and not even a call. How unprofessional. My weekend is so important as I am a working mom and this is what I experienced.

10-20-2022,2:43:00 PM,1,"Disaster with ?10,000+ Platinum Cleaning","I had a disastrous experience with Urban Company (UC, formerly Urban Clap). I booked them for the Platinum Cleaning Package for a furnished 4 BHK apartment. Per UC’s website and app, it includes all of the features of the Premium package, plus wet vacuuming of upholstery, among other things.  The experience was quite challenging from the beginning, although the staff with whom I interacted were polite:
- UC was incommunicado between my booking and service time, a period of four days.
- The team was two hours late.
- The team was inadequate, too young, and poorly equipped.
- Their idea of the cleaning contract was different from the UC website and app.
- The team requested cancellation.  My refund from UC fell short of the amount I had paid.
Here are the details:
1. I attempted to book UC’s service in October 2022.  In my first attempt to book cash-on-delivery, the required up front payment of ?1, 000/- was successfully deducted from my bank account, but not credited to my UC service.  It was eventually refunded, but I was asked to rebook using a payment method different from Net Banking.
2. When I rebooked, the payment options required full upfront payment, in excess of ?10, 000/- which I made.
3. The service date was four days after the booking date.  Yet, there was no contact on my mobile, email, or app until 45 minutes before the service time, on the service date.
4. Also, during this period, there was no way for me to contact UC via email, app, or telephone.
5. The service was picked up by Prabhas Mukhiya, a team leader.  I called him up immediately to ascertain whether the team would be on time, given that the scheduled time was only 45 minutes away.  He initially assured me that they would.  I had a total of 6 telephone calls with him.  During that time, he indicated that he was in touch with the team, and that they would be no more than 30-45 minutes late.
6. It turns out that he did not really communicate with them during this period, as he acknowledged.
7. Eventually, at one hour and 45 minutes after the scheduled time, he promised that the team would be there in 10 minutes.  And they were.  The team was nearly two hours late.
8. There were only three of them, although the website indicates 6-8 professionals.  They had only a dry vacuum, and no wet vacuum as required in the Platinum service.
9. They were very young boys, ranging in age from about 13 to about 20.
10. The eldest among them, Deepak Mukhiya, a cousin of the team leader, said that he could arrange for a wet vacuum, but only five seats could be wet-vacuumed.  For seats beyond the first five, I would be charged extra.  There is no such specification on UC’s website or app.
11. I showed them the 4 BHK apartment, and they agreed that the three of them were insufficient to do the job within the promised 8 hours.  The eldest among them began calling other teams.  His calls would either not be picked up, or he would be put on hold.  Eventually, he requested that I cancel the service.
12. I did so, but did not receive a full refund.  It was short ?299/-, which happens to be the annual price of ‘Plus’ membership. I have requested a refund of this amount, but have not received it.
13. I posted multiple feedback items on UC’s website about my experience, including my request for a refund of ?299/-.  There was no response.  Eventually, I posted the observations up to Item #12 above.  Within half an hour, I received a call from UC’s representative, Mr. Gaurav.
I re-outlined my bad experience, and requested the remaining refund of ?299/-.
1. Mr. Gaurav initially said that no refund is possible.
2. I pointed out that the website and app does provide for refund.
3. Then Mr. Gaurav changed his position, and said that the only refund is of the whole amount, at the end of a year, provided the service is not used at all.
4. I pointed out that the website and app does provide for partial refund, of excess of membership fee over the total discounts availed.  For example, if total discount of ?200/- is availed through the year, then the remaining ?99/- is refunded at year-end.
5. Then Mr. Gaurav changed his position again, and acknowledged that a partial refund is possible.  At this point, he spoke with his senior, and returned with an offer to refund ?150/-, while keeping my membership open.  He said he could not refund the remaining ?149/-.
6. Unfortunately, the refund cannot be made in the same way as the original refund, into my Amazon Pay balance.  It can only be done via UPI or Net Banking.  I do not use UPI.  For Net Banking, I have to provide my NEFT details.
7. I indicated to Mr. Gaurav that this partial refund did not address my need, as I desired a full refund with a full cancellation of Plus membership."

10-18-2022,10:51:00 AM,1,Poor work,"We had booked for tank cleaning
Their services were very poor
They damaged the fittings which led to water leakage continuously.
We had to call an experienced plumber from elsewhere and had to get it fixed ..which cost us an additional 2500
We will never recommend them for any service
They could not clean our kitchen chimney too ...because they were not trained in it"

The professional quoted 22k in app and took 7k + from me. They have a hurry to get all the money. After receiving money they hardly responds. Just say we are sorry and run away.They did the unsatisfactory work with all wrong colors and inferior paint quality. And also denied to refund my money and give proper service. I would suggest never go for this service if you don't want to spoil your hard earned money. There services are fake, worst and nightmare. All money wasted."
10-12-2022,7:18:00 AM,1,BAD SERVICE,They dnt have professionals. Pathetic service. I booked cleaning. Salon. Etc. Everything is pathetic.

With the urban company mediator in between over the call, the professional agreed to return our Refrigerator in two days.

Neither any email nor any updates or call backs of any kind resulted to our messages sent left on their application. We have now filed a police complaint against UrbanCompany.com."
9-30-2022,12:00:00 AM,1,UC damaged my TV & removed all expensive parts,"My 42""LG smart tv had only cuff problem initially which was inspected by UC's two different technicians, Yogesh came at home and had no other issue but finally the 4.95 rating guy Masahud Sheikh took our tv for repair, gave no receipt and got it back after a week with totally damaged tv, removed our original motherboard, connector's strips our display panel with two huge dents in the back of the tv, my tv is fully broken now. Not working at all, no one is bothered to even repair or come look at it, Urban Company is nothing but a hub for a gang of cheaters and scammers. Their goon workers and back-end management work hand in hand, we complain to them but they are deaf to our problems and ignore us by all means ..
Save yourself from this brand and officially we must try to stop this company's malpractice. They are criminals, looting innocent clients. It’s a racket going on which must be stopped. We will be making an official complaint to our home minister regarding this issue and will take the matter to the consumer court. This syndicate needs to be stopped.
Now when we called LG service center, technician came, he saw the tv, after inspection he said the tv is fully gone, better you throw it as it will cost 28k plus as everything is spoiled in this, all the original parts are gone. The only person who took our tv from our home is Masahud and all parts were removed by him.
UC back-end team Shubham also didn't help us, instead started defending his company and UC out of fear for his job. Masahud UC tv technician put universal old parts in our tv which didn’t work even for one hour, after the tv was brought back to us by Masahud .. he is the biggest scammer in the whole gang .. this management is nothing but a fraud nexus running wild without any fear for the law and order. They don’t fear the gov or court or anyone, they are running this company and looting scamming stealing from innocent clients in broad daylight.. we have LG service Center technician quotation now of the current status of our tv. Our 80k tv is totally garbage now :(, the LG technician said better to buy a new tv instead of repairing so much damage. It’s damaged beyond repair :(
Their supervising team says they are not responsible if the tv is broken fully. Reason they didn’t give us the final bill yet and didn’t collect the money yet, but then they also took our brand new tv and got back some chor bazar tv and gave us back with all original parts removed.
This is a very thoughtfully done & pre-planned crime they are doing, this kind of corporate crime must be stopped asap.
We were told that we don’t have the bill so we are not eligible for anything.
During the time of delivery, we asked the technician to give us the bill. To which the technician said he will get the bill in 5 mins from his vehicle, and he never came back. He didn’t come back to give the bill.
Later we found out that all our original LG parts were removed and replaced with cheap generic parts. it’s not our tv anymore, it’s a dummy tv. With all fake parts inside just the cover was of LG, which also has two dents now Nothing inside was original in it.
The floor supervisor Sandeep says we don’t give any acknowledgement receipts to any client while taking the tv from them ever, he says it’s company policy .. we are not allowed.
This statement proves the crime in itself.
We have full faith in our judiciary law Honourable court will do the justice for such dirty white collar day crimes done by Urban Company to innocent customers.
We have all chats and audio/video recordings of the technician and back-end team .. while taking the tv.
We have a video recording in our CCTV when the technician was taking the tv with him and when bringing it back all are recorded in our CCTV ..
It’s a breach of trust, fraud, cheating and malpractice,
In the name of a licensed corporate company. Their license should be revoked by the legal authorities. And this company should be stopped from functioning at all.
They are cheaters.
Is this the kind of India we are building ?
Is this the India that we want for our children ??
Is India going to be ruled by such corporate private companies? No.
How can this daylight robbery be allowed?
Officially legal relevant authorities please help the customers/clients here and kindly support us in bringing it down. Help Indian citizens."

Its just a year old flat and all fixtures are new. Same fixtures are installed in the 3rd bathroom(Guest) which we did not opt for from Urban so luckily saved. When I raised complaint UC didn't help and just replied only for 3 days warranty has been covered.
Rusting is a slow process so we realized after 3 days and I paid annual membership fees also which they not refunding. Don't opt UC, they lock the bathroom and don't know which all chemicals, harsh machines used by them which damages the fixtures."

When I tried to ask the professional straight away he ran from my premises. After that I raised this issue with snaps with UC customer care through UC app. They said they are calling professional but he is not picking up their calls but withing 24hrs they will resolve the issue positively as appliances are covered under insurance of rs. 10000/- in case of damaged during the service. And now it's been more than 24hrs now but didn't hear anything from UC staffs. Also they have closed the chat just by updating our executive will call you soon. They have disabled the chat option for so I can't even do the follow ups on my complaint. Somehow found their head office and Bangalore office contact number they didn't pick the call. Can't expect this kind of unprofessional approach by UC towards the customers. I am just advising all not to use their services as they are not reachable at all in the event of any fault from their side.

I subscribed to their premium package for 6 months. I was told that they send their best staff, however its only to earn more money.


Arrogant staff.


I was actually advised by them that the house needs cleaning before they would deep clean the house.


I was advised of a long list of things they won't clean like windows, glass door, in built wardrobe from outside, etc, these are covered as part of the package in their website.


The apartment is unfurnished  with inbuilt wardrobes, I was told that it qualifies as furnished apartment.

08-05-2022,8:33:00 AM,1,Cleaning Flat,"Hi,
I booked a cleaning service for 2BR flat in Bengaluru on 3/Aug. and scheduled the work at 10 am on 4-Aug-22.
However, I received a call at 8:33 am on 4th Aug., from+918037775241 and the call was cut. When called back, the person did not take the call(3 times). At 8:46 am I got call from+911244577364 and the lady told me that the service needs to be rescheduled at 12 noon. I agreed, though was not comfortable at 12 noon. Then, at 11:18 am I got a call on my mobile, from+918045810842, saying the call is from Urban Company(UC) ""Associate"" and asking for my mobile number! Told the person to check my bookings and get my number. I refuse to share my mobile number with unknown persons. After this, I waited at the apartment from 11:50 am and wasted my time as none came to do the cleaning. I sent a message on WhatsApp, but have not received any reply! But when checked on UC website, it says my service ""Request Cancelled""! And that too I requested to cancel! What a lie!
Now here are my questions:
Service has not been done, after paying money in advance. And then the service is cancelled without asking me, telling lies!  Website does not have a 1800 number also!
Does it mean Urban Company(UC) does not want business. Then it should stop accepting and collecting on the website.
When will I get the refund of amount paid?
All staff start talking in Hindi, as soon any customer picks up call and converse in Hindi, without manners. If they want, let them ask the customer, language of preference than assuming Hindi as preferred language.
Next, when they call back let them check if customer is free to talk(esp. if someone is driving or in a meeting, etc.)
I put a message in UC WhatApp, regarding my waiting at the apartment and I am yet to get any response after 24 hours. Also I tried+9112444577364 and could not reach anybody. Later sent an eMail for which I got an automated reply which has no meaning. I want UC to refund my money with penalty for wasting my time, energy and using mu advance payment.

But after a few days of usage we noticed that the cooling issue still persit insist a huge consolidated Fog sort of is dispensed .  We again called the AC technician or repeat service .   He inspected and
pacified the people at home that it is normal . But we have 3 split AC's in the house serviced by the principal company and they are 100% fine.   Now after a month the AC is gone 100% flat only air coming no cooling at all. though we have not used AC due to rainy season in the last month+ .  Urban company is washing off their hands saying you will have to again pay for service . This is not good . rather better to deal with local area technicians they are moderately priced and quite considerate .

7-27-2022,9:17:00 AM,2,Urban company,"Here's my experience with urban company
If I talk about Urban Company
I  like its app very much.  It is very easy to operate it. And it has many features and also very user friendly.
They support their customers very well.  He listens to his whole story and tries to figure out the solution.
I have no complaints with Urban Company at all.
But but but
Earlier I used to use it a lot, but I have stopped using it now because of their technicians.
Their technicians are very useless.
He will destroy himself more and then ask for money to fix it.
And then they will start their game.  They people will say that by not talking to the urban company, they got this work done personally.
Then they will offer you that we will do your work at half the rate.  Instead of getting it done by urban company, get the work done by us.
And by criticizing the urban company, they will say that they only give commission from us.  He has no work.  We will do the same work for you for half a rupee.  If you withdraw your complaint from Urban Company.
Same thing happened with us too.
We too fell in their trap.
But once you give money to them, then these people will stop picking up the phone and will never come back.  Then even if you call in the urban company, then they too will not be able to help you because you had hired to be personally.  There is no fault of the company in that.
But I believe.  There is some fault of the company in this.They should give good training to their technicians and keep good technicians.His own technician abuses urban company
And we had met the technician only through the urban company, then the urban company should take responsibility for it or they should alert in advance that if something like this happens, then you should not fall in that trap.
My Daikin AC was damaged by a technician from Urban Company.
Then I had to get it corrected by the official technician of Daikin Company, whose bill was ?; 12000 to me.
I think I have waste my 12 thousand more just for the sake of ?; 400.  So from now on I get all my AC serviced from Daikin official service center only. Because daikin service AC in 900 and urban company in 500 but
Their technician is not professional at all.
Hope this helps you"

07-10-2022,3:03:00 PM,1,Bathroom intense cleaning.,Had signed up to get there bathrooms cleaned. Was impressed with the fact that they had said they would start at nine in the morning the professional called to say he would be fifteen minutes late. He came half an hour late. That was still okay. At every point he would say he couldn't do this couldn't do that as the house was old. So none of the stains in the bathroom were addressed giving this excuse. On top of that he was on a personal call for one hour of the one and a half hours he spent in the house so obviously his mind was not concentrating on the work at hand. After doing two bathrooms when I pointed out that the condition of the bathroom was the same as it was before cleaning he got annoyed and asked me to cancel the service and asked me to clean it myself. That was really the last straw. Absolutely no courtesy and very unprofessional attitude. Will never recommend. Don't know how they have branches in Singapore and Dubai if this is the sort of service they provide.

After million complaints & repeated customer service calls, I managed to get a professional for inspection where he clearly mentioned that it will require 2 services and change or parts.
So UC asked me to book services again on COD for cleaning as well as plumbing and sent a professional for cleaning who had no knowledge that I won't pay him UC will. The professional did his job & later texted me that UC denied the payment to him. The plumber also came but denied fixing the tap as it required a change of parts and mentioned very clearly that "" UC DOESNT PAY US BACK "" so he cant provide the booked service. PLUS professional did not even wear a UNIFORM.
I spoke to multiple customer support staff since 5 July but they all are USELESS

It stopped working completely and all the items inside fridge is rotten. We had daily needs for baby and we were completely disappointed with the service provided by technician named Santhosh. I booked for revisit twice and next time some other guy came and he was also harsh in responding. He has asked us to wait for two more days until wednesday. Who will take care of all expenses of rotten things for next two days?? Will urban company bear it? We already spent 15000 rs. Customer care also unethical and doesn't assign technician. They say they have only few SMEs and don't get their slots. Technicians speak in rude way that the job cannot be done within timeline.

5-30-2022,6:57:00 PM,1,DO NOT CALL URBAN COMPANY,"Lets understand the model of aggregators such as Urban company. to meet their financial targets, these aggregators such as UC empanel some street boys/ vendors after their some very basic checks and verifications etc. When customer complains, UC rely heavily on inputs from professionals and never bother to visit the site for first hand verification of the matter and issue. this leaves customer at the mercy of the telecalls.  Competency of these boys is a big question. The big safety concern is that the so called'professional' brings with him some other street guy to'assist' him. And this second guy is not verified and not trained and not a professional. This second guy is just another labourer / maid type, who does all heavy physical work such as scrubbing etc to make things  cleaned visually and in process damaging the items.  Second big concern is the unverified / uncertified chemicals(mostly acids) they use on our costly  equipments/ fittings and fixtures. I had very bad experience  with UC.'Professional' and his'assistant' damaged chrome electroplating and put big scratches on my costly bathroom fittings using very hard scrubbers and chemicals. my suggestion to all customers is to take good quality HD pics of all fittings and fixtures and keep as record. you will need these pics at the time of claim. in my case UC claimed that my fittings were like that only. When I asked urban company to share pictures taken at the end of the job by the'professional', they did not. And on regular follow up of  the case, UC used their last tool i.e. the refund. Now see what customers have to settle with, is damaged equipments and fittings fixtures.  The'professional' left work without completing full job when damage was shown to him. the'professional' was leaving behind the'assistant' to complete the job so that he could attend another UC job somewhere else. In my opinion it is better to call local helper and use some good quality cleaners which are easily available in market and online(Amazon etc). you will find so many videos on youtube for DYI cleaning hacks.  you will be saving lot of money by avoiding expenditure on restoring and replacing your costly items. DO NOT spoil your things by calling UC professional. I did and now wasting time writing reviews."

05-11-2022,11:58:00 PM,1,Scammers,Well never ever get services from urban clap. They are the biggest scammers and finding new ways to fetch money out of your pocket. Well I booked for AC service from this company for my 2 air conditioner and as per company policy they provide you a 3 months warranty on that. So that if in any case there is any problem you can call them within 3 months and you can get it fix under warranty. Now on April 16th I got both my air conditioner serviced and after few days one of my air conditioner started giving problem so I called them and they booked a revisit. Now again I started having problem with the air conditioner and I asked for revisit. To my surprise they told me that I cannot book a revisit because I have already claimed a re visit on that. So if this is the case then why you provide warranty for 3 months then. When I told them this thing they asked me to re book a new service and they will refund me the amount of 1900. Now here is the scam they doing. I paid 3700 in total for the services. Out of which they refunding me only 1900. Then they ask me to book a new service and then they charge 499 plus taxes plus the repair cost. So in that ways the 3 months warranty is just a show-off and they have new ways to fool people and fetch money. Please beware of this company. They are scammers. It's better to get AMC from the manufacturer directly. Never fall for this trap with urban clap

With out removing the unit the cleaning could not be started. After trying for some time I managed to open one side of the AC front cover, how ever the other side was still not coming out, as per the technician the wall placement was incorrect and so the cover was not coming out. They decided to aondon the job. How ever in the app i was charged with ""partial work done"" and refund of ?200 was initiated.

NOTE - earlier the AC was fully cleaned by other experienced Urban Clap employee, by successfully removing cover.

I had raised a issue in the app, and every time I got a call back from the team, (once they had spoken) to them, my voice became inaudible and they disconnected. Their final verdict was nothing can be done.

While booking I was assured through the app:
1. Incase of service dissatisfaction, urban clap would send back their technician without any questions asked.

I WAS NOT INFORMED OF ANY ""CONVEYANCE"" FEE CHARGES

Resolution request from my end:
1. Pls resend person to complete the task of AC cleaning or,

05-02-2021,7:37:00 PM,1,Fraud company don't book services.,"Urban company is a fraud company doing scams in the name of cleaning and other repair services.Pl don't opt for their service of any sort seeing their ads.Their service is of poor quality and is unhygienic.Their professionals don't follow Covid appropriate behavior and will damage ur product/Appliance/building and will loot extra money .First they won't respond to complaint later they will tell senior technician will assess the fault and charge u an inspection fees, later they will tell part replacement and collect money and later they will say part wasn't available and escape.Also you won't be able to contact their customer support through phone calls.Only way to contact them is through call backs via help center or tagging them in social media platforms or mailing to them.Their service personals are extremely rude and unprofessional.If you are not trusting my review pl go through other reviews on the internet and ask your friends and neighbours who have had their service and they will explain.Someone must take the issue of filing a case against this company for cheating customers in the consumer court."
04-12-2021,1:32:00 AM,1,Cheating by Urbaan Company (formerly Urban Clap),"Never ever call Urban Company(formerly Urban Clap) for servicing your air conditioners.  The air conditioning service scam of Urban Company is going to rob you off your hard earned money and precious time apart for giving you sleepless nights in the summer.
I have four Daikin ACs fitted in my house. They are running absolutely fine for last seven years. Fortunately no maintenance requirement has arose for any of these units except for the annual servicing, basically a thorough cleaning. The cooling has been absolutely fine. At 27 deg C setting they are able to make the rooms absolutely comfortable.
This year I made the mistake of calling Urban Company for AC servicing, primarily driven by their highly publicized advertisement claiming professional service. This single mistake has made my life miserable since a week as the AC servicing by the scam company  turned in to a disaster for me.
On the fateful day 8th April, me and my husband took a day off so that the AC servicing is done properly. Urban Company had assigned a certain Faizal and one assistant for this job. To my surprise the Faizal guy started the work without bothering to ask for the OTP. First he struggled to take out the cover of the AC. At one point of time my husband had to caution him as it looked like he might  break the cover in his struggle to remove it. After removing the cover instead of going ahead with the cleaning he removed the plastic cover on U bends of the condenser tubes and switched on the AC without any rhyme or reason. When my husband asked what he is doing he simply said he is checking the AC functioning. We were wondering when we have not complained of any issue why is he opening and fiddling with the AC. If he wanted to check the functioning he could have run it before opening. When my husband was showing the outdoor unit to his assistant, Faizal was doing something in the indoor unit and I heard a fizz/ hiss sound, indicative of some air leak. When I asked him he said that Madam there is no gas in the AC, gas has become empty and compressor is tripping. I called my husband and he confronted him saying that till yesterday it was running whole day and cooling fine, how the gas became empty and compressor treated tripping after your fiddling with the AC. Then Faizal started arguing telling how we can accuse him of causing the gas leak and started showing a puncture in the u bend of the condenser tube whose cover he had removed without any reason. It is a mystery that without a pressure testing how he discovered that micro sized puncture within seconds. He never admitted that he has purposefully or accidentally punctured the tube. Then he started offering to fill the gas at Rs 2500/- saying that through Daikin it will cost Rs 3500/-. We  have no doubt in our mind that the Faizal guy did the puncture and leaked the gas on purpose. May be Urban Company has discovered that through this kind of business strategy they can drain more money from the customers.
Anyway, after this my husband was very furious and he told the Faizal guy to stop servicing then and there and asked him to put back the things. He was also annoyed with me for calling Urban Company as he wanted that the servicing should be done by Daikin only. But the misery was not over. Faizal who was certainly not a trained professional and was less skilled than a bicycle repair man was now struggling more to put back the cover. During this I do not know what he did but I heard a crackling sound. When I asked him without answering he was trying to put the cover back. With my insistence he said that the drain pipe has broken and he could repair with m seal. When I asked how did you break it initially he said it was already broken and later said that possibly it might got broken by me. I am certain he broke it on purpose as we stopped the servicing and asked him to go. Anyway, my husband asked him to leave immediately. He was requesting us to cancel the booking from our end telling that service guy did not come. If he did not come, how can he be blamed for all that he did wrong? We immediately reported it to Urban Company. One Towseef Ahmadmir was assigned for resolution of this issue. We explained him the whole episode. he spoke to Faizal and responded by saying that the gas leak is not the fault of Faizal as he is denying purposefully leaking the gas. For Towseef whatever Faizal says is  gospel truth. If one asks a thief whether he has  committed a theft, what would be the answer? Towseef promised to return the amount paid and the bill incurred by repair of drain pipe from Daikin limited to Rs 500. We later discovered that he has refunded paid amount, transferred Rs 500 to my account and has cancelled the booking closing the channel of communication. Further  he does not take calls and does not call back even when message is left.
I had called Daikin technicians. They say the drain pipe fitting has broken from the drain tray and the entire drain tray will be replaced, Rs 1800/-+GST. Leak detection through nitrogen charging, brazing to arrest leak, further leak testing, gas filling operation to cost Rs 3500/-+GST, visiting charges Rs 590+GST. Hopefully in next two-three days the ordeal of not having your AC functional in hot summer will be over.
The purpose of penning down the incident with all these details is not to express my anguish, disappointment and frustration. It is warn fellow AC users looking to get their ACs serviced in this hot summer about possible cheating and getting ripped off by Urban Company and their fake technicians.
Anyone thinking to get ACs serviced by Urban Company please read very carefully:
(i) Never call Urban Company, call directly the Manufacturer's authorized service center even if it is more expensive
(ii) My experience shows Urban Company technicians/ partners are fake, have little training and no knowledge of AC. They are going to spoil your AC by default if not by design.
(iii) Even if you decide to engage them, be very watchful. At the first opportunity they will leak the gas from AC by punching a micro hole through the gas tube. It is difficult to catch if you are not carefully observing. then they will offer to fill the gas and extort money.
(iv) If you do not play to their plan, they will break something, drain pipe, cover or anything that is easy to break. Again to replace it and extort money.
(v) If you approach the customer service they will not get to the root of the problem or how to avoid repetition in future. They will transfer Rs 500 to your wallet and close the booking so that further communication is not possible.
(vi) Further they do not pick the phone"

04-07-2021,9:43:00 PM,1,Worst Painting Service Ever Had,This was my worst decision to trust an app based service provider for painting service. They take full payment in advance and leave you at the mercy of their service partners. Urban company's team does not care how much you complain regarding the quality of service they provide. Their sales team agrees to all your points before you make the payment. Their implementation team talks totally different. The guys who came to do the work did not bother to look at the quality of work done. I am still waiting for their senior staff to visit and have a look at the quality of work done even after making the full payment in advance.
04-06-2021,5:56:00 PM,1,Paid subscrption not visible in app,"I have recently purchased an urban company subscription on 5th Apr 2021(299 for 12 months).

Also unable to locate there customer care number to escalate this.

The technician came and even without checking for the source of a possible gas leak, took out aflame device using a can and heated the ac coils in the indoor unit and then scrapped it. Then he said the coils are damaged and refused to fix it. The ac is completely damaged . Their customer care refuses to acknowledge, refuses to refund or compensate!"

And even if you provide the feedbacks and reviews with comments, it doesnt make sense as they will be reverted back and they can change whatever they want. and also be aware, even if you book the  slot with name, there is no assurance that the same person can come for the service.They are sending just the Un-professional labours instead of the professional trained ones.No where in the portal has mentioned to reach them or customer care numbers.
If you want security, I feel we shouldn't use this App for any kind of service, as they loot the money for no reason.
no trust on the brand URBAN COMPANY(Formerly URBAN CLAP)."

Thought I will use their painters to paint my home, as this will mean I dont have to deal with the painters directly and a professional company will take care of that for me.
This company Urbanclap Urban Urban Company is fraud.
They promise you and assure they will take care of everything and when you pay them - they vanish.
I signed up for painting - and was assured 2 painters will be assigned to complete the work.
First day - only 1 painter turns up saying second painter is busy
Second day - painter says is sunday wants holiday
Work pending - the job done on day 1 is absolutely shoddy.
I tried complaining to Urban Company - no one answers their phone, the person who took my order - does not answer phone, I gave complain through APP and was told 60 minutes will receive a call. Over 3 hours nobody has called.
I am cancelling this order and now lets see how the fraud company handles the refund."
02-01-2021,4:47:00 PM,1,Poor quality washing machine repair,The problem was not solved. The lg front loading washing machine used to vibrate a lot and moved around the space often banging into walls. No satisfactory resolution was provided.
1-25-2021,4:23:00 PM,1,Geyer Servicing,"We have actually booked for Geyser servicing after seeing a lot of colorful adv on TV to lure customers. We also fall for that trap, so their serviceman came and saw our geyser and recommended to go for a new one instead of repairing the old one. He also mentioned I will also inform the company that he did not do servicing, but only he checked.
Now the drama starts, they have sent me the invoice for servicing and closed. I went back asking why they have billed me for service when they did not do it, instead, they should have charged me for a checkup.
A new twist in the story, after repeated calls to customer service and explaining, they have come up with an idea, the executive told me the serviceman has installed the geyser and for that, they will charge. The dumb a_ executive don't even know what he is saying
First of all, If you want to check or service a geyser he needs to remove from the wall and keep it on the ground to check.
When I made him realize that he kept my call on hold and come up with an idea saying when he has installed from the wall we will charge for that which is the same amount that I was billed. So, the bottom line is they don't want to return my money. Such as cheap and crap people.
Pls be beware of this kind of people, they can rob you of anything."
1-21-2021,7:46:00 PM,1,Urban Company Loves Ghosting. Beware!!,"I booked a facial appointment for my mom after seeing so many attractive advertisements of Urban Company. But alas.The beautician didn't show up. It felt like being cheated and ghosted by your boyfriend. LOL. We kept calling her but all her numbers were unreachable. They didn't contact us at all even as we kept reaching out to the customer care(which is only one-way messaging system).  The beautician didn't arrive at all, so cannot comment on their services.
Their customer care is a bigger fraud that I have ever seen. They tell us that we will receive a callback or something but they just cancelled the booking and vanished. I again reopened the booking asking for why the beautician didn't come. They again closed it without any comments. I actually feel like laughing at their organization structure.
If they keep carrying on this way, I am not sure how long will their business last. They should learn how to treat their customers from brands like Amazon.
Anyways I am sharing my story so that nobody gets ghosted the way we did by a company which is so highly spoken of. I am really surprised. A very disappointing experience from such a company.
PS to Urban'Ghosting' company- Please stop spending so much on advertising and focus more on customer care and employee services."
01-10-2021,9:02:00 AM,1,Poor service and poor issue resolution.,I writing this after consistent bad experience. The professionals are Pathetic every possible way- work or behaviour. Customer service team keeps enjoying there time. They never resolve the issue and never take actions. They would only call you later post every thing only to reschedule the service!
01-03-2021,12:31:00 PM,1,Urban Company has no business ethics,I made a booking for bathroom cleaning and paid Rs 988 via net banking. The amount was debited to my account. However I received sms from UC that payment failed.  Even after 48 hours the payment was not reversed by the bank which clearly showed that the payment reached the account of UC. When I raised the issue with customer service I was told that it will take 5 to 7 business days to refund the amount. What legitimate right UC has to retain my money for 7 days without providing the requested service.  If a payment failed it has to be reversed within few hours. Imagine 100 customers paid the amount which failed in the system but UC decided to keep the money for 7 days. In this digital era why would someone require 7 business days to reverse the payment. For no fault of mine I have to block my money with UC which didint even bother to provide the promised service. Looks liketheir only concern is to get money from the customers.  If they  follow some business ethics then they should also provide the option to make payment after the job is completed. Collecting cash in advance and then claiming that payment failed despite receiving the money into account is very unethical.  Customers should watch out when making payment to this company. Another important point to highlight - UC DOES NOT PROVIDE A CUSTOMER SERVICE PHONE NUMBER for customers to call them up.  The only way to communicate with them is by email and we know many times the emails are ignored and they can decide whether to  replky or not. It is a good way to hide themselves when there is an issue.
01-03-2021,6:23:00 PM,1,No proper floor cleaning machines,"I booked Platinum deep cleaning service thru Urban Company(UC) for delivering service for 2 January 2020. They did all the work and when asked about floor cleaning the professionals told that they planned to do using hand. I objected since UC on their website had assured to get floor cleaning done thru Industrial grade machine. The agency when told about it brought a Prestige floor polishing machine telling lies that it is a floor cleaning machine. I objected and asked help online on UC website and was told that another agency will get it done using Industrial Grade machine the next day 3 January 2020 by 11 am. The next day a new group of people showed up at the door again with a polishing machine, I again requested help thru helpline and was told that another agency will contact by 1:30 pm with the machine. It is now 5:30 pm and now one have showed up. What kind of service is this. I have driven close to 10km from my temporary accommodation to get this work completed by today so that I can shift with family today. No one from Urban company has contacted me to check if any one has come too. This is totally unprofessionalism at its peak.
Customers are left to fend for themselves with these unprofessional and lying agencies of Urban Clap. Now the helpline number available thru Urban company website is also I am not able to access so thought of putting this complaint on this link. Hopefully some one from UC will take notice and provide me the floor cleaning service as indicated in their online Platinum package soon."

3, the person kushyadav@urbancompany.com helped me on preparing teh quote now he is also not responding .


No customer care number exists, wondering if they need to care about customers only then a number is required.


Colors what we discussed and what they paint is totally different and the answer is ask the person who committed this.


they started painting and stopped stating no paints available, looks like our house is a shelter for them.


during the discussion they showed me a shade card and while painting they are refusing to share the same .


Complete false/fake commitments.

Pros:


Structured app. Easy to navigate.


Assigned workmen are well trained and well equipped.


Escalation channels in case an assigned workman refuses to do the job or wants cash(Had once instance - complained - a new workman was assigned immediately)


Actually cheaper as compared to the locality plumber / carpenter .




Con:


Perhaps too structured. In case you have a mix and match of odd jobs - or you have a very unique problem - well it's better to call the locality plumber / carpenter. Options to specify job related requirements doesn't exist .



Have used them for the following services so far .


AC service


Toilet(western style) replacement


Carpet cleaning

10-30-2020,2:27:00 PM,1,Avoid Urban company for peace of mind,"Urban company is a gang of cheaters. Please do not use any of their services if you want to avoid unnecessary headache.
I used their chimney repair service. The technician took the motor for rewinding, billed for shaft and bearing replacement but actually did nothing except cleaning. Charged Rs 2500/-
Problem repeated within one month. When Called for within warranty repair, he told me that now this is a new problem and blower is broken.
I was not convinced with his arguments and called the other local technician. He dismantled everything in front of me and I was shocked to see that blower was perfectly alright and only cleaning work was done where as billing was done for shaft and bearing replacement. I sent all the images to urban company but till today no response.
Apart from above I observed their approach to the customer is very unacceptable. The technician won't provide their mobile no instead they ask to call thru app which is irritating and time consuming.
Don't fall in the trap of costly TV adds and find local technician if you want to have peaceful life.

10-23-2020,8:12:00 AM,1,BUNCH OF CHEATS,"BUNCH OF CHEATS. Urban Company is the most ridiculous and unprofessional organization on this planet. Their so called 'Professionals' like MOMRAJ and ABDUL SALAM never arrive for the service and they keep rescheduling the bookings. Since 18th October, they have rescheduled the booking 5 times and today also no one has arrived. These people switch off their phones and ay times even lie that they will be there in 5 minutes and never turn up. There is 0 Customer Support available from them."
10-23-2020,6:54:00 PM,1,House painting services,"Please dont take their services, no one will visit.
They take money and vanish. Get the work done from local guys, you will save money!
They charged me over and above other vendors, still gave the contract thinking will get the services as promised but in vain
I paid for fresh paint, the contractor was trying to do the repaint and wrap up. No masking done, my furniture was kept in open when putty work was done. They took money for Royale matt but painted by entire room with Emulsion when we caught this they raised the voice. We selected the color on day 1 and gave the confirmation but on day 8, after common color was put on 3 walls he coming up and saying ""dark color ka shade nahi hai market mai, sara selection change karna hoga""
What the hell!  Please change the name from Urban company to Lootera Company!
Beware guys.!"
9-28-2020,6:22:00 PM,1,AC repairing issue,"I am Vihar Gandhi(+91-7777070163) living in Ahmedabad. I belong to a small lower middle class family having value of every single penny and having only one AC at my home. Unfortunately my grandmother is suffering from cancer and currently on chemotherapy who cannot bear heat and continuously she has to use an air conditioner. Since I have heard/observed positive feedback of Urbancompany from friends and relatives, even Urbancompany turned out to be good for me as well for many other services experienced except mentioned below. Tentatively before a month there was a cooling issue in AC which is used by my grandmother. Thought of using Urbancompany services which turned out to be the worst decision of my life.
On 4th September technician BIPINKUMAR A SHAH was assigned to me who visited and after thorough investigation he figured out gas leakage and refilled gas, which was billed around 2500/-Same amount was paid by me with trust on technician without negotiation, and yes luckily I have opted for warranty. 15 days later the same issue reoccurred and since it was under repair warranty, same technician came and again after thorough inspection he repeated the same process.
Again after 10 days same cooling issue recurred and I thought of calling/appointing another technician this time as I felt that the previous technician was having lack of knowledge.
This new person Mr. Hemang Suthar came and inspected everything and told me to install new copper pipe set of at least 3 meter, which I again agreed due the reason of my lack of knowledge as I do not belong to this field and in front of me my grandmother was there who is on chemotherapy who has to be in AC 24 7.
I agreed to that person, he did his work, installed new copper pipe, again filled new gas and this time I paid 4550/- with the mindset of getting a solution for the sake of my grandmother. Now, Again after 8 days same issue reoccurred and according to Hemang Suthar’s guidance I called company person,
Company person said “ due to previous 3 faulty repairing cooling coil of internal unit has got seriously damaged, and surprising your person / mr.hemang Suthar agreed This faulty repairing issue has leaded to
1.serious damage of my internal unit’s cooling coil


waste of hefty amount of money earned by only earning member of lower middle class family.


waste of time as whenever a person comes for repairing I have to take leave from office as there is nobody in my family except my grandmother and working wife at home.


mental harassment for us and the past 1 month was not at all good due to those technicians who were in lack of knowledge and everytime asking me to pay for spare parts/gas filling without having conclusion on proper fault and this resulted in damage of my ac. Now to this series of issues, faulty repairs, damage to my AC, harassment to our family, I Have decided to get it repaired from the company itself. Due to blind trust on Urban Company I have accepted whatever technician asked to replace, and paid whatever amount they said. This trust leaded to damage to my AC, and hampered my grand mothers health All these services and payments are under warranty(although your person was not able to detect problems/damaged my AC) Now, I request you to kindly help me to get my money back for AC and all the product which was damaged because of this. I am so frustrated due to this and I have decided that  if I do not get an proper cooperation from Urban Company I would be dragging this matter to court of laws and will fight until I do not get proper solution.




Would request a quick positive revert."
9-27-2020,2:47:00 AM,1,Urban company thief’s,"Never trust urban company or clap they just eat people’s money they don’t have professionals at work they just get a random guy to have the work done
I ordered for a pest control and with in a day the cockroaches are back
Urban company is waste of company don’t go for it"
8-29-2020,8:05:00 PM,3,Painting work not completed,"We had booked for Urban company for painting our 2bhk flat in JP nagar  Bangalore. Painting was done well, but balcony painting was not done even after repeated reminders it is still pending since two weeks."
8-18-2020,4:53:00 PM,1,AC Servicing,"The Urban Company's  AC Technician could not complete the servicing of a 1.5T Split AC of Carrier Make . Infact he did not know how to reassemble the indoor wall unit after dismantling it for servicing. He wasted about 3 hours trying to do the same but without any success. Even as on date, the cover of this indoor AC unit is not getting clamped / locked as a result of which the AC wall unit could fall down any time and lead to an accident.  As a consequence, this AC(which was operational till their AC technician attended to it) has now become totally ""inoperable"" besides becoming prone to an accident any time. Upon lodging a complaint on the Company's web portal there has been no response even after about 10 days. Further, their web portal does not allow the customer to send any reminders for the complaints already lodged nor do they have any provision for registering /reminding them about complaints telephonically. Incidentally, after registration of complaint on their web portal, no acknowledgement is sent to the customer on his / her email ID or thro' SMS which clearly indicates that there is no way the customer can escalate their complaints to external agencies like Consumer Forum etc for seeking redressal of their grievances."
8-14-2020,11:39:00 AM,1,URBAN COMPANY - The Worst Service Provider EVER!!,"The repair services they provide have exorbitant rates but the service provided is third grade. Everytime I have booked a repair service the issue was not resolved by the professional. I had to seek outside help. The professionals cannot be called professionals because they have no clue what’s wrong. They are inexperienced, rude, not at all punctual, misleading. As soon as they step in they convince us to give them good rating without even starting the service. UC does not have a customer support number, you need to place a call request and wait for a call, if the call gets dropped you can’t even place another call request.
I had multiple pathetic experiences but one experience in particular I had was with the professional Manaskumar Mishra who is a plumber on 13th Aug 2020. I had a very minor leakage problem in  my kitchen sink. My service was rescheduled twice and then also he showed up late. He dismantled the sink and parts. Said issue with the pipe. Fled with the pipe part saying he is going to get a replacement. When I after after 2 hours he said DEKHTA HUN. I raised a complaint spoke to an executive and was promised a call back in half an hour which never happened. I tried calling the professional, he received and rather than listening to me he said the UC lady spoke harshly with him and used profanity and he will complain against her. He didn’t listen to me and disconnected. I waited till the next day morning and requested a call back from someone. Got 3 calls from customer care only (Sarfaraz, Mohit) upon lodging a complaint again and call got dropped and didn’t receive a callback . I called the professional 4 times no response. My service was abruptly ended on the app without my knowledge, and asking me to pay 99 and to rate my experience and give feedback, well here it is. I got a professional plumber’s no and asked him to come and fix it. We got the know Manas had broken the tap and fled. There is no way to contact urban company. When I am requesting a call back it automatically says complaint already registered.
REFRAIN FROM USING ANY OF THE SERVICES FROM URBAN COMPANY ESP REPAIR!!"
08-11-2020,10:02:00 AM,1,Repair of Bosch Washing Machine,"On 28th may first service was done and we paid rs. 444/- by cash. Machine was completely rectified and service engineer mr. Md. Moin uddin has mentioned that there is some problem in pc board and charged rs. 3, 000/-. The machine has hardly worked for 3 days and the same problem was repeated. Your service engineer mr. Moin uddin has visited another 2 times and made some futile attempts and could not repair the machine. Now the machine is not in working condition. I have through mobile app lodged complaints several times. But no response at all. Your service engineer is also not lifting his phone. We really feel bad having paid total amount of rs. 3, 444/- for servicing of washing machine your urban company could not service it and has put me in hardship. With this bitter experience we are loosing faith and confidence on urban company.
You service engineer: mr. Md. Moin uddin
His mobile no. [protected]
Subsequent to my complaint New Technician has come on 7th  Aug'20 and checked the Washing machine. He mentioned that previous Technician has given wrong connections and due to which PC board and other parts of the machine like sensor and others got damaged and need to be replaced.  The technician has told that total cost will be around Rs. 8, 000/- . Then Urban company representative has come into conference call with me and the new technician Mr. Syed Akbar and started negotiation. First of all there is no mistake of ours in this entire process. All the damage happend is due to the wrong connections given by the  Urban Company's previous technician only which is confirmed by the second technician Mr. Akbar. Why shall a customer be punished for the mistake of incompetent technicians hired by the Urban Company. Ultimately Urban Company has negotiated with me for another Rs, 4, 000/- to get it completely repaired. I was forced to agree for this since I don't have any other alternative and I am badly struck with Urban Company.
New Technician has taken away on 7th the PC Board and other damaged parts for replacement and promissed that Washing machine will be repaired within 3 days i.e., by 10th of Aug'20. Now when I called him he he says that the PC board is complete;y damaged and company is not responding for replacement. I have lodged a complaint on 10th evening for their response. They have not responded to my complaint also.
I sincerely feel I did a blunder mistake choosing the Urban company.
I humbly request to escalate the issue to the concerned officers and help me  for resolving the issue.

08-06-2020,7:41:00 PM,1,Experience with Urban Company,"It's important to know why the service is called deep home cleaning. The service provided is not what is described on Urban Company. I raised a complain after I received their service yesterday, and UC confirmed to rectify the mistakes by sending an expert team from the same company. I did raise my apprehensions over this, because I know if the same person is sent to do the job they will continue do what they did earlier. Today they came again, and they did do some work but not complete work. I told them to clean the toilet completely, but they did not do it. They did not mob the floor before leaving and they did not even inform me before leaving. I trusted and believed them to do their job with utmost commitment, but i was wrong. There needs to be someone watching over them and tell them what do and where to do.
I could have done the same job by hiring a maid. They say industrial grade chemicals, but I do not believe it is. I can use Domex cleaner and get the house cleaned better. The showcase glass were also not cleaned properly and also the trolleys in the kitchen. I can point out a lot of flaws in the service. You take 25% commission from the service provider, I expect you to take the responsibility as well."
7-26-2020,11:01:00 AM,3,Worst Service Providers,"Dear all. This is the first time I am writing a review for any firm. I got my AC repaired through Urban Company rep at a cost of Rs 10, 500 and only a couple of days later the AC performance was back to square 1. I requested the rep for timely guarantee repairs however the professional named D Bhanu Prasad kept on delaying his visit. Finally he visited after a week and did something to make the AC operational. AC performed for a couple of days and the problem recurred. Tried calling the technician thereafter however he blocked my number. The customer service also denied to render any assistance in this regard. I was cheated and robbed of Rs 10, 500 by booking this service. Just a recommendation for all that rethink 100 times before booking urbanclap services. Couldn't give zero stars because the app doesnt accept it therefore giving 3 stars which the app accepts. Thanks"
7-23-2020,,1,urban clap sucks,company sucks they more of a barbarian shop never go for repair any thing
07-06-2020,11:41:00 AM,1,Unprofessional Urban Company,"Urban clap professional damaged my TV and now no one is answering my calls. They have blocked me from raising any complaint. I spent Rs 6849/- for my TV repair and Sukriti from Urban Company told me to get this in writing from other TV mechanic that my TV has been damaged by UC professional, how absurd. Who will write this."
3-24-2020,,1,The worst decision,A third grade service. I had booked a technician to repair my air conditioner n to my disappointment I was fooled n cheated of RS.2500. my ac still has not been repaired n money is already been taken. A pathetic service n feel disgusting to see celebs promoting a brand with maximum number of negative comments
